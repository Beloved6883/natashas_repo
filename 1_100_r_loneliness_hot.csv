0,loneliness,t5_2rlb9umjzi6,Tell us your story...,"Everyone is lonely, but not everyone is lonely in the same way.

Some people are lonely when they're physically isolated from others and some people are lonely even in a room full of people that love them.

Those are two common examples, but there are endless ways in which people can feel lonely, 8 billion ways in fact.

And there's not always a clear answer; some people are just lonely. It's a normal part of the human condition to feel lonely, and while you may want or even need to do everything in your power to rid yourself of it (depending on the severity of your situation), just know that being lonely in and of itself doesn't necessarily mean that there's anything wrong with you.

We don't measure or rate or judge each person's level of loneliness here and decide if they're ""lonely enough"" to be welcome here nor do we dictate any absolutes about the conditions for being lonely or how someone must behave if they're ""actually lonely.""

Every human-being in the world is welcome here, and their story for how they feel loneliness is valid; their pain is valid. As with most things in life, there's the book definition of a thing and then there's the complex emotional reality of a thing. Loneliness is a relative experience, and the way some people experience it won't always make sense to others, and it doesn't have to.

Just as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to feeling loneliness, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to healing either.

I don't presume to know your pain; we don't know your pain; tell us about it:

If you're feeling such extreme pain from loneliness to the point of contemplating suicide, please don't. **Just don't.**

Things to consider:

- **How old are you?** Did you know that the brain isn't fully developed until around the age of 25? That means that if you're a child, teenager, or even a young adult, by merely waiting out the storm, you might find sunshine on the other side, by simply maturing into the fully-formed you.

- **How bad is it?** As bad as it can get, it can almost always be worse. It's important to respect everyone's pain, because it's relative. As much empathy as one can have, you can never really feel another's pain, only your own. Still, it's important to keep perspective and think about the cruelty and lack of freedom experienced by those around the world.

- **Time is a master in its work.** We've all heard the saying that ""Time heals all wounds."" Well, it's pretty true for the most part. As long as you first get away from the toxic people, places, or circumstances that are hurting you and causing you trauma, the healing can begin. How long it will take, really depends on the person, and what they've experienced. It took me years to get over some of the trauma that I suffered. It's not that I don't still feel some level of pain from it, but my trauma no longer owns me; I own my trauma.

Suicide prevention starts and ends with you. Life is full of neverending beauty and darkness. I don't know about you, but I want to see it all. I want to stay on the path that is existence for as long as I can, even if at times, I have to walk through broken glass.

But, sometimes you need a little help. Share your thoughts here in this sub, reach out to a mental health expert, or maybe give a suicide hotline a try. As tacky and empty of a gesture as it might seem to put out the cliché boilerplate message: ""If you're having suicidal thoughts..."" I don't know, maybe these tools are actually pretty helpful for some people? It might be worth a try. The big one is:

2,loneliness,t5_2rlb918fopa4,How NOT to make friends in real life,"Loneliness sucks. What sucks even more is trying so hard to make friends in real life and failing. I shall try and turn my rampant bitterness due to my failures in making friends into a bad humour thing. So here we go, how NOT to make friends:

1. Put yourself out there and glimpse around different events and such. When noticing everyone at events are either with friends or in groups while you are sticking like a sour thumb or alien put your cool face on and tap yourself on the back for being brave

2. Chat with real life people about common stuff and smile when you (full of innocence and wonder)  ask to exchange social media contacts while they go into full avoidance mode and the music in the pub is too loud and they just can't be bothered 

3. Get really insecure about being lonely or an alien because it could only ever be your own personal fault (note the sarcasm?) for not having friends

4. Meet random people in real life, trying so hard to be friendly until they ghost you for no reason at all 

5. Do all the text book stuff: go to workshops, gatherings, cultural events, even book clubs. Pat on the back for getting outside of the house. Go back home with ""such empty"" feeling of people just not giving a damn

6. Be a complex person of 1000s of interests, hobbies and passions. Textbook stuff will tell you that's ideal for meeting new people. Real life will punch you in the face and usually you'll end up being too much or just crippling around with your lonliness luggage to ""admire""

7. Give up the whole idea and withdraw back into romanticized ""solitude"" of ""being your own best friend"" and totally disregard biological, mammal need for social interaction and community belonging

8. If bitterness arises (and it will and it will be time before Christmas and it will seem everyone has friends accept you) try to laugh it off or fully give in to people hating. You are entitled to your own inner Grumpy Archetype",1.0,5,0,5,False

I thought it would become a new chapter of my life. But little did i know that it would be the darkest. I literally failed to make a single friend here, this means that i have nobody to interact with. It gets much harder on the weekends. It was my fault for hanging out with the wrong people that i would eventually never see again. Now im left with absolutely nobody. 

What concerns me the most is the fact that i have lost connection with my other friends from the country that i grew up in. This leads me with absolutely no friends left. I feel like everyone has forgotten about me. I miss my family, my previous friends, my old job and everything. And i usually see on social media that they are having fun and living life. While i am at my lowest point, in my apartment, in a country that I don’t know anybody. It’s a shame because i always thought i had social skills. Im not an introvert either. 

I hate social isolation. It’s the worst feeling. It feels like it’s draining my brain overtime. I am left exhausted everyday and i have no motivation to study or to do anything. Days can go by without me speaking to someone. I have no energy at all. Before all of this i used to be so productive, studied hard, worked out a lot. I even would cook for myself. But now It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even get out of bed anymore. I have spent so much money on food deliveries because i feel like I’m paralyzed. It’s been months like this..

I have no real friends, no real goals in my life, no feelings of empathy towards others, and few expectations for my own future; My own dissapointment for myself has always been like this, and at this point, I highly doubt things could even change for the better. I'm currently taking AP and honor classes, I have good grades, and have high expectatives from relatives, but I feel that all of this is completely worthless: A couple of years ago I was excited about high school and having a promising future by admitting higher education, but, today, I find myself helplessly lonely, distressed, weak, impotent, and lethargic, while I continue to deceive myself from escaping this torment.

I don't have any real friends or relatives: The few friends I have, barely talk to me now and/or rather choose to ignore me alltogether. It has always been like this, but I emphasized that, by having friends again, things could maybe change for the better. Now, however, I have come to the conclusion that there is no real escape from this delirium: I will always feel this way, no matter the amities, grades, professional help, dedication, or motivation I have.

I don't even know what I really have left. The only reason my life still has a purpose to serve, is to discern if, perhaps, this will be the last day of my ruthless ordeal.

Hi all.

I am posting this for my research team. We are a group of undergraduates from The London Interdisciplinary School working with a social movement called Camerados to help make their 'public living rooms' more engaging and relevant to a broader range of cultural backgrounds. At the core of this is understanding why loneliness occurs, why people become disconnected and how we can attempt to reconnect people with movements like Camerados that can make you feel less alone.

Events at Camerados are without agenda. Camerados sees that the answer to our problems is each other. Whether that is talking about the larger problems we face in life or what biscuits we want with our tea today! Everyone has tough times and we think it'd be great if people looked out for one another more. Not fixing each other. Not trying to solve anyone's problems. Just being a bit more human. The events take place in temporary living rooms in the middle of the street, pop-ups or in permanent hubs in your community.

Thank you to anyone who fills this out - you are making a difference!

I had friends when I was 16-20 years old but I stopped being friends with them because they never wanted to work or do any outdoor activities besides smoke weed at a park or in my friends basement. I made a YouTube channel with one of them hoping to make money out of it as my parents were recently divorced and I moved in with my mom and my mom was single making about $18 an hour.

Everything was good for the 3.5 years of being with her, we had ups and downs but our downs were really abusive and mentally frustrating and I later found out she cheated on me plenty of times.

56,loneliness,t5_2rlb9188hv5t,Sharing my experience and battle with loneliness,"Hi all, 28 years old (F) after 4 years of therapy and losing and gaining friends I wanted to share my experience. I have never felt lonerier in my life despite having an interesting career and boyfriend, and 2-3 good friends. I  have never been the most sociable and as a kid I always felt that couldn't belong. Girls didn't like me and boys were making fun of me. As a young kid and teenager, could not comprehend what was wrong with me, why did I feel so lonely around people. With the years, I got shy and closed off but learned how to trust and connect when I decided to overcome my fear of socializing and moved abroad for studies. I remember how scared and excited I was. For few years, I felt the sense of belonging, I lived in a lively city and made good friends and people with whom I could connect and share experiences but also life in a way as we were all young students away from home and this common experience bonded us. Fast forward to some years later, I changed 3 different countries and now I have settle somewhere where never thought I would be for more than 1-2 years. I started getting shy again, and all of the things I hated about myself (my lack of social skills or autism? not sure) came back to haunt me. I got scared that I am reaching 30 and will end up alone. I always had people to go out, and I partied a lot but none of these things really fulfilled the void in me. I started thinking about my family and how I missed being with them, but I knew that I chose this lifestyle for a reason, and I shouldn't be afraid to experience life. I met my current partner with whom we live together but we are fundamentally different, and this started having an impact in my life as he is extremely outgoing and always wants to be around people and talk for hours. I cannot do that as socializing is exhausting me after 2-3 hours. I like being alone, but I feel lonely because I am surrounded by people who do not really understand me. I just wanted to share my experience and hope that I am not alone in this. I many times wondered if it's truly me, and there's something I should change about myself. When I am around people, I enjoy it but then I get exhausted and want to come home to watch my shows, read a book or play with my cat. I believe that having a partner that understands that is important because mine has been harsh and judgmental and arguing with me that I have defeatist attitude and that to not be lonely I need to just start doing activities. I crave connection but I also don't know how to approach people. I tested for autism and got high probability of developing one. I am always worried not to say weird things because of previous experiences I had in which people called me weirdo and autistic. Since I moved with him to suburbs I have spend most nights home alone. I have tried to make friends in the new country but unsuccessfully. I feel that I need to break up because this is not the person that gets me but then I am afraid that there won't be anybody else and will be alone.

I hoped they would see the good person that I've become.  That they would see how I take care of myself and the people I love.  Then they would appreciate me and want to be with me.  I built my life around that notion.  Literally every aspect of my life was built on becoming such a good human being so that somebody would see me, the real me, and fall in love with that person.  How could they not?

I grew up in a family full of wretched awful people.  I made it my life's goal that I would not become like them.  That I would do everything in my power to break the cycle of being hateful and petty.  I would be different.  I would lift people up instead of kicking them down.  I would praise them instead of insulting them. I would be there for them when they needed a hug, I would not avoid and abandon them in their time of need.  I would become reliable, loyal, and trustworthy.  I would not lie to them for my own personal gain.  I would be present in their life and not tell them to fuck off if I was busy with my own shit.  I would listen.  

I was hopeful.   

Once upon a time, I was hopeful.  I don't know what I am anymore, or who I am becoming.  I don't know what goals I should be aiming for.  I'm lost.  

Nobody sees me.  Nobody understands me.  Nobody cares.  Not really.  

So wtf is love supposed to be anyway?

Does anybody really care anymore if you're a good person.  From what I can see, all the assholes and shit people in the world are ones who are in love and starting families.  

Should I have tried to be good?  Does anybody appreciate being good anymore?  Does anything even matter anymore?  Should I just not give a shit and do whatever the fuck I want, walk all over the people in my life for my own personal advancement.  Maybe then I'll find love.  Maybe then I'll stop being lonely.

Soy un hombre de 30 años. Estoy solo. Nadie tiene tiempo ni deseos de escuchar la tristeza de un hombre adulto y solo.
Tengo sentimientos encontrados frente a mi misma vida. Tengo un buen trabajo y no tengo ahorros significativos, pero me doy a mi mismo lo que quiero. Sin embargo tengo que trabajar 6 días a la semana jornadas de 10 horas en una labor para la que soy bueno pero no me hace nada feliz, pero que más dá? Si abando o mi trabajo moriré de hambre y nn podré pagar una renta. Trabajo de casa así que no tengo tiempo de socializar ni hay alguna persona especial en mi vida. 

He descubierto que estar solo durante largos periodos de tiempo se siente bastante parecido a estar muriendose. Así me siento. No estoy viviendo como tal. Estoy muriendo lentamente, día tras día se me va la vida en una nada tras otra hasta que se acabe por completo y muera...

Tengo un círculo de personas con las que me relaciono. Son mis compañeros de academia de artes marciales. Sin embargo ellos no saben lo que me ocurre. Para mantener a las personas cerca de mi tengo que mostrarme siempre muy positivo y optimista. Cuando la gente te ve caído suelen alejarse de tí...

Yo soy mayor en edad y también en talento de combate, lo cual ha generado una relación de jerarquía entre nosotros y ahora es más inapropiado que ellos me vean mal o sepan que estoy vulnerable... En mi familia es igual. Todos me identifican como un tipo súper apegado a su trabajo. He podido ayudar a mi hermano y a mis padres con mi salario...

I just get so mad now and I cry myself to sleep constantly thinking about not being lonely, it is of course a dream I feel I can never reach, I try to interact with other but everyone is busy which is not their fault people have their own lives and that's ok. I've been in therapy since I was five due to my high level of anxiety mixed with the devil that is ADHD. I want to destroy everything around me into pieces. I want to die painfully so I can feel the sweet relief of death sometimes. I've been put in a mental hospital when I was ten because I wanted to end my life and of course I don't want to think that way anymore but I can't help it, I'm such a disappointment to this world and people that have had it worse then me are still going and I makes me feel even more weak and hopeless.

I found myself sitting alone all the time, not speaking to anyone. As a result of me being alone all the time, my depression was getting worse. I feel extremely alone, especially now that my best friend got a boyfriend and she has been hanging out with him more than me. Don’t get me wrong, I am happy for her but I can’t stop feeling like I’m getting replaced. She was the only person I told everything to, the one I laughed with the most, we have many inside jokes, etc… and to feel like they’re taking her away from me just hurts.

I am an ambivert, I love talk to people, meet them, but I don’t know how to do it on purpose. I am interested in many things, if i feel comfortable I can talk about anything! But I don’t know how to meet someone. How to build my own life. I also have depression, so sometimes it’s hard for me to initiate communication even with closest ones. Honestly, there is so much love and will to support inside of me, i think i can be good friend (but not with anyone). I love to listen so much. Talk about someone’s feelings and problems. And I want to be friend with someone like me. Interesting (for me), supportive person. I don’t have anyone to write when I feel really really bad and lonely.

I thought that everything will be normal when i start going to college. But it has made me even more depressed

The starting days were good. Not many students came in the first week as many students live out of the city. So i made a friend. We both hung out with each other and all. Then more students came and we made more friends. 
It was going great for the 1st month but then things went downhill when i went to a family function for a week. When i came back, i felt like i was not part of their group. They were having their own inside jokes, privately messaging each other, and all. I tried to ignore it at first but then i couldn't take it anymore. Then in the lab class, i was completly heart broken, the profeesor told us to make a group of two to perform experiments, they made groups on their own and left me out. I just felt like shit. 
Then many more incidents happened when i felt like i was the last priority for them. 

I tried to look up to google about what to do, it suggested to meet new people and all. I'm not an introvert nor an extrovert. So i seriously tried to connect with new people.

Now, at 26, I've completely turned my life around regarding drugs and destructive behaviors, nearly two years clean, regularly attending Narcotics Anonymous. I've seriously started working in the restaurant industry, stabilizing my life. But, I don't know, there's no one around me.
